# javascript and classes


====>>>> do javascript have classes


Yes, JavaScript has classes! They were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to provide a more structured and familiar syntax for object-oriented programming, but they are essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance system.


## OOP
oop is a programming paradium for JavaScript


## Object-oriented programming
- collection of properties and methods
-toLowerCase 

## why use OOP 

1. Organized and Modular Code

-- OOP helps structure code into logical "blueprints" using classes and objects.

-- Code is modular, making it easier to reuse, maintain, and debug.

2. Reusability (Inheritance)
OOP supports inheritance, allowing child classes to reuse properties and methods from parent classes. This reduces code duplication.

## part of OOP
object literal(this)

- constructor function == provide new instance always using (new) key word 
- prototype 
- classes
- instance (new , this)

## 4 pillars 
abastraction == hide details
encapsulation == rap up data 
inheritance == 
polymorphism == one method do multiple things 



## Magic of Prototype in javascript

array -> object->null
string  -> object->null
